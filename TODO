Here are a couple of suggestions of aspect of glcs that I think could be improved:

- Increase the number of piping scripts to server various purposes.
- Add ffmpeg preset files to fullfill the various Internet Streaming service encoding requirements.
- Usual stuff: bug fixes code and doc improvements
